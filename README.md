## 🔌 API Integration

The application uses a structured approach to interact with the YouTube Data API:

### Key API Endpoints Used

1. **Search API**
   - Used for finding channels by name
   - Returns basic channel information and IDs

2. **Channels API**
   - Retrieves detailed channel statistics
   - Gets customization settings, topics, and keywords

3. **Search + Videos API**
   - First searches for videos from a channel
   - Then gets detailed statistics for those videos

4. **ChannelSections API**
   - Retrieves featured/related channels

5. **CommentThreads API**
   - Gets comments for specific videos

### Data Processing

All API responses are transformed into strongly-typed data structures:
- Raw API data → Type-safe interfaces
- String numbers → Parsed integers
- ISO dates → Formatted readable dates
- Nested data → Flattened for easier consumption

Example of formatted video data:
```typescript
export interface FormattedVideoData {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  publishedAt: string;
  description: string;
  tags: string[];
  categoryId: string;
  viewCount: number;
  likeCount: number;
  favoriteCount: number;
  commentCount: number;
  topicCategories: string[];
  hasPaidProductPlacement: boolean;
}
```

## 📈 Metrics & Calculations

The dashboard calculates several key metrics to evaluate channel performance:

### 1. Subscriber Conversion Rate
Measures how effectively a channel converts viewers to subscribers.
```typescript
calculateSubscriberConversionRate(channel: FormattedChannelInfo): number {
  return (channel.subscriberCount / channel.viewCount) * 1000;
}
```

### 2. Channel Activity Ratio
Evaluates how active a channel is based on video publishing frequency.
```typescript
calculateChannelActivityRatio(channel: FormattedChannelInfo): number {
  const channelAgeInDays = (new Date().getTime() - new Date(channel.publishedAt).getTime()) / (1000 * 3600 * 24);
  return channel.videoCount / channelAgeInDays;
}
```

### 3. Audience Retention Strength
Measures how well a channel retains its audience.
```typescript
calculateAudienceRetentionStrength(channel: FormattedChannelInfo): number {
  const avgViewsPerVideo = channel.viewCount / channel.videoCount;
  return (avgViewsPerVideo / channel.subscriberCount) * (1 + (channel.videoCount / 100));
}
```

### 4. Channel Growth Momentum
Assesses the growth rate of a channel.
```typescript
calculateChannelGrowthMomentum(channel: FormattedChannelInfo): number {
  const channelAgeInDays = (new Date().getTime() - new Date(channel.publishedAt).getTime()) / (1000 * 3600 * 24);
  return (channel.subscriberCount / channelAgeInDays) * (channel.videoCount / 10);
}
```

### 5. Content Subscriber Efficiency
Measures how efficiently a channel's content attracts subscribers.
```typescript
calculateContentSubscriberEfficiency(channel: FormattedChannelInfo): number {
  return channel.subscriberCount / channel.videoCount;
}
```

### 6. Channel Rating
Calculates an overall channel rating from A+ to D- based on weighted metrics.
```typescript
calculateChannelRating(metrics: {
  subscriberConversionRate?: number;
  channelActivityRatio?: number;
  audienceRetentionStrength?: number;
  channelGrowthMomentum?: number;
  contentSubscriberEfficiency?: number;
  channelEfficiencyIndex?: number;
}): {
  rating: string;  // A+ to D-
  color: string;   // Color code for visual representation
  description: string;  // Explanation of the rating
}
```
